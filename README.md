# Student Dropout Prediction from Higher Education 


## Project Overview

This project aims to tackle the issue of student dropout in higher education by using machine learning techniques to identify students at risk of not completing their studies. By analyzing factors such as academic performance, demographics, and socio-economic background, this model can help institutions take early action to support at-risk students. By identifying these students early in their academic journey, the ultimate goal is to reduce dropout rates and increase the success rate of students completing their higher education programs.


## Dataset
The dataset used in this project was collected as part of a research initiative aimed at reducing academic dropout and failure in higher education. It includes information known at the time of student enrollment, including:

- Academic Path: Information about the student's academic performance and progression.
- Demographics: Age, gender, nationality, and other personal details.
- Socio-economic Factors: Information related to the student's economic background.

The dataset's primary focus is to predict the students' academic status at the end of their program's normal duration. The classification task includes three categories:

- Dropout: Students who left the program before completion.
- Enrolled: Students who are still enrolled in the program.
- Graduate: Students who successfully completed the program.


## Project Goals
The primary goals of this project are:

- Build Classification Models: Develop machine learning models to predict the likelihood of student dropout, ongoing enrollment, or graduation.
- Identify Key Influencing Factors: Analyze the factors that contribute most to student dropout.
- Improve Academic Success Rates: Provide actionable insights to help educational institutions implement strategies that can reduce dropout rates and increase student success.


## Methodology
The following steps were taken to achieve the project goals:

1. Data Preprocessing:
- Cleaned and transformed the dataset to handle missing values, inconsistencies, and data types.
- Addressed class imbalance using synthetic oversampling techniques.
  
2. Feature Engineering:
- Selected relevant features that influence student dropout, enrollment, and graduation.
- Explored relationships between various academic, demographic, and socio-economic factors.

3. Model Development and Initial Tuning
- Developed  your Machine Learning model.
- Fine-tuning model using techniques like Grid Search and Cross-Validation.

4. Evaluation:
- Evaluated model performance using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Performed cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning to optimize models.
  
5. Interpretation:
- Analyzed the importance of different features to understand which factors most influence student outcomes.
- Provided insights and recommendations for educational institutions to support at-risk students.
